<p align="Center">(Automated Login API which automatically login into SRM Wifi)</p>

---

I built an Automated Login API which automatically login me to the SRM Wifi after connecting through a single click. It requires to set the SRM wifi username and password for just one time and it works individually.

The language that I used - Python   
* Pre-requsite Libraries - Selenium, Beautiful Soup(bs4)

  `pip install selenium`  
  `pip install bs4`
